### Point of Failure
I'm a DJ for UMD's on-campus, student-run radio station! I'm currently on hiatus, but I broadcast all semester long. 
For more information on UMD's radio station, see WMUC's official website [here](http://www.wmuc.umd.edu/). My show is 
once-weekly for an hour. Below is an archive of all previous broadcasts, both on WMUC's digital (streaming) and FM (88.1) 
station.

### WMUC FM (Spring '20)
I'm going to embed the audio files if I can figure it out.

### WMUC Digital (Fall '19)
- November 11th, 2019
