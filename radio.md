# Point of Failure
I'm a DJ for UMD's on-campus, student-run radio station! I'm currently on hiatus, but I broadcast all semester long. 
For more information on UMD's radio station, see WMUC's official website [here](http://www.wmuc.umd.edu/). My show is 
once-weekly for an hour. Below is an archive of all previous broadcasts, both on WMUC's digital (streaming) and FM (88.1) 
station.

## WMUC FM (Spring '20)

## WMUC Digital (Fall '19)
