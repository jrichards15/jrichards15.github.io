## Associate Flight Software Engineer @ AST Spacemobile

I am a University of Maryland graduate with a degree in Computer Engineering, with interest in embedded programming and audio processing. This website is a showcase of my most recent projects, some interesting and some noticeably less so. Most of these projects are written in Python and C++. The C++ projects are all for the STM32H745ZI nucleo board, as it features a massive number of useful peripherals and provides a good starting platform for a lot of the more interesting embedded projects I've undertaken.  

I strive to continue my education through practical experience, as I prefer the learn-by-doing process over simply reading a textbook. This website is a showcase of this practical approach to my process, and to display my techinical and career interests. My past work experience is an expression of this process, as I have taken a variety of internships and positions in order to more fully understand the utility of specific technical skillsets and the real-world applications for software development as a whole. For projects and general notes, see the __Blog__ section for more information. This page contains all posts pertaining to my personal interests. For a synopsis of my work experience and academics, see __Resume__. For an archive and description of my college radio broadcasts, see __Radio__.

## Ongoing Projects (without Blog posts)
- Modular Synthesizer (fabrication & design), with the end goal of producing a DIY performance-ready musical instrument.
	* Currently building Mutable Instruments Plaits, Veils, and Ripples. See [here](https://mutable-instruments.net/) for more information on the modules. Open-source information can be found on Emilie Gillet's [GitHub](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack).
	* Currently designing a sampler based on an obsolete answering machine IC and an input module to convert line levels to be compatible with standard Eurorack levels.
	* Recently began writing an audio synthesis platform featuring a text-based UI with a character LCD and encoder, parameterizable audio processing effects and synthesis, and support for a multitude of possible extensions, which will be tracked in the blog as I complete them. All hardware drivers are written using the STM32 HAL libraries and a mix of C++ and assembly code. 
- Lyrics Checker update (see Blog), with user authentication for support of private playlists, etc.
